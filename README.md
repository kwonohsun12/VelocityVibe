# VelocityVibe

This project aims to develop a system that detects sudden acceleration of vehicles and provides notifications to users. 
When a sudden acceleration event occurs in the radar system, relevant parameters are sent via an API. 
The system receives these parameters and plays an alert sound to notify the user. I will write python code by receiving parameters from the radar API.

# cmd
pip install sounddevice
pip install numpy
